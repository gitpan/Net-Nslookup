	* lib/Net/Nslookup.pm: Calls to nslookup return if there is nothing
	passed in, but after creating the Net::DNS::Resolver object. This
	can be used to "seed" the module by pre-creating the object. 
	Lookups of MX and NS records return IP addresses rather than
	hostnames, by recursively calling nslookup as needed.
